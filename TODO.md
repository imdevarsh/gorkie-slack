# TODO

- Migrate to AI SDK Agents
- Add ability to give file outputs
- Review Claude's refactor of getContext to per thread, see if thread refactor affects ratelimits
- Preinstall Image Magick and other packages
- Add more proper and detailed examples to the AI, AI gets confused about attachments dir still...
- Think about security too...
- Why do we still store the sandboxId in redis, with the TTL of 10?
- Cleanup vibe slop
- See how it works, if you interrupt the task
- Give it context, gorkie that it can't login or do authenticationj and stuff so it cant use githb etcetc
