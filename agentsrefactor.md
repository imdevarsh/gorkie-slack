# Agents Refactor Preflight

Before starting any work in this refactor context:
1. Read `REFACTOR.md`.
2. Read `~/.claude/conventions` (or `~/.claude/conventionsj` if that is the file in your environment).
3. Read `~/.claude/AGENTS.md`.
4. Read `TODO_REFACTOR_IMPLEMENTATION.md`.

Do not begin implementation steps until all four are reviewed.
