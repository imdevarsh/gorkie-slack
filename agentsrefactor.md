# Agents Refactor Preflight

Before implementing refactor work:
1. Read `REFACTOR.md`.
2. Read `MAIN_BRANCH_SANDBOX_INVESTIGATION.md`.
3. Read `TODO_REFACTOR_IMPLEMENTATION.md`.
4. Use `TODO_REFACTOR_IMPLEMENTATION.md` as the single source of execution order and acceptance criteria.

Implementation rule:
1. Hard-cut E2B only.
2. No legacy compatibility paths.
